# TODO

Once someone creates and sends a request, he can expect to receive the correct amount of money. But how does he keep track of the payments due and received?

There are different methods available for the requester and payer to agree on the payment status, and that is when Payment networks come into play.

Payment networks allow developers to:
* Detect blockchain-based payment automatically
* Declare other kinds of payments completion

Request is blockchain agnostic, payment methods that are suppored for automated payment dection are: Bitcoin, Ether and ERC20. If you miss your favorite blockchain, you can either get in touch with the team or *learn how to do it yourself*
